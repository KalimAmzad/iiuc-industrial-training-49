This Python script is designed to provide an in-depth understanding of Python's conditional statements.
We will explore:
1. Basic if, if-else, and if-elif-else statements.
2. Logical and boolean operations in conditions.
3. Real-world applications with engaging examples.
4. Nested conditional statements for complex decision making.

Each section includes detailed explanations, examples, and assignments.

# Section 1: Basic Conditional Statements
# ---------------------------------------
# The `if` statement is the simplest form of control flow, allowing for conditional execution of code blocks.

# Example 1: Simple if statement
# age = 20
# if age >= 18:
#     print("You are eligible to vote.")
#     print("Please register to vote as soon as possible.")

# # The `if-else` statement provides an alternative execution when the `if` condition is not met.
# # Example 2: if-else statement
# temperature = 30
# if temperature > 25:
#     print("It's a hot day.")
# else:
#     print("It's not a hot day.")

# # The `if-elif-else` structure allows for multiple conditions to be checked sequentially.
# # Example 3: if-elif-else statement
# score = 75
# if score >= 90:
#     print("Grade: A")
# elif score >= 80:
#     print("Grade: B")
# elif score >= 70:
#     print("Grade: C")
# else:
#     print("Grade: D or F")

# Assignment 1: Write a Python script that determines if a number is positive, negative, or zero using if-elif-else.
# Write your code below:
my_number = 10
if my_number > 0:
    print("The number is positive and it is", my_number, "!")
elif my_number < 0:
    print("The number is negative and it is", my_number, "!")
else:
    print("The number is zero!")


# Section 2: Logical and Boolean Operations
# -----------------------------------------
# Logical operators (and, or, not) are used to combine conditional statements.

# Example 4: Using logical operators
# height = 175
# weight = 70
# if height > 170 and weight > 65:
#     print("You are fit for the sports team.")
# else:
#     print("You do not meet the physical requirements for the sports team.")

# # Example 5: Combining conditions with or
# day = "Sunday"
# if day == "Saturday" or day == "Sunday":
#     print("It's the weekend!")
# else:
#     print("It's a weekday.")

# Assignment 2: Create a script that checks if a person is eligible for a senior citizen discount based on age and residency.
# Write your code below:
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
residency = input("Are you a resident? (yes/no): ").lower()

if age >= 65 and residency == 'yes':
    print("Congratulations!! You are eligible for a senior citizen discount.")
else:
    print("Sorry, sir! You are not eligible for a senior citizen discount.")

# Section 3: Real-World Applications
# -----------------------------------
# Applying conditional logic to solve real-world problems.

# # Example 6: Nested if-elif-else in a real-world context
# # Ticket pricing system with age and membership checks
# age = 65
# member = True

# if age < 18:
#     price = 10
# elif age >= 18:
#     if member:
#         price = 15
#     else:
#         price = 20

#     if age >= 65:
#         price -= 5  # Discount for seniors

# print(f"Ticket price: ${price}")

# Assignment 3: Write a script that simulates a basic login system. Check username and password correctness.
# Write your code below:
username = "admin"
password = "admin"

if username == "admin" and password == "admin":
    print("Login successful.")
else:
    print("Login failed. `username` or `password` is incorrect. Please try again.")
    


# Example 7: Loan Approval System
# This example uses multiple conditions to determine if an applicant qualifies for a personal loan.
# income = 45000
# credit_score = 700
# employment_status = "employed"
# existing_loans = False

# if (income > 40000 and credit_score >= 650) and (employment_status == "employed" and not existing_loans):
#     print("Loan approved.")
# else:
#     print("Loan denied.")

# # Example 8: Environment Control System
# # A system that adjusts temperature and humidity based on multiple sensor readings.
# temperature = 22
# humidity = 85
# weather_outside = "rainy"

# if temperature < 20 or (humidity > 80 and weather_outside == "rainy"):
#     print("Turning on heating and dehumidifier.")
# elif temperature > 30 or (humidity < 30 and weather_outside == "sunny"):
#     print("Turning on air conditioning and humidifier.")
# else:
#     print("No change needed.")

# # Example 9: Custom Shipping Logic
# # Determine shipping costs based on weight, distance, and customer loyalty.
# weight = 5  # in kilograms
# distance = 300  # in kilometers
# is_loyal_customer = True

# if weight > 10:
#     shipping_cost = 25
# elif weight > 5:
#     shipping_cost = 15
# else:
#     shipping_cost = 5

# if distance > 200:
#     shipping_cost += 10

# if is_loyal_customer:
#     shipping_cost *= 0.9  # 10% discount for loyal customers

# print(f"Total shipping cost: ${shipping_cost:.2f}")

# Assignment 4: Implement a system that categorizes a day based on temperature and weather conditions.
# Use nested if-elif-else and logical operators to determine if it's a beach day, skiing day, or a stay-home day.
temperature = 30  # in Celsius
weather = "sunny"

if weather == "sunny":
    if temperature > 25:
        print("It's a perfect beach day.")
    elif temperature > 15:
        print("It's a nice day for a walk.")
    else:
        print("It's sunny but too cold, stay home.")
elif weather == "snowy":
    if temperature < 0:
        print("Great day for skiing.")
    else:
        print("Snowy but not ideal for skiing, stay home.")
else:
    print("Not a sunny or snowy day, best to stay indoors.")

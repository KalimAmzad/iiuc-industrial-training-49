This Python script is designed to provide an in-depth understanding of Python's conditional statements.
We will explore:
1. Basic if, if-else, and if-elif-else statements.
2. Logical and boolean operations in conditions.
3. Real-world applications with engaging examples.
4. Nested conditional statements for complex decision making.

Each section includes detailed explanations, examples, and assignments.

# Section 1: Basic Conditional Statements
# ---------------------------------------
# The `if` statement is the simplest form of control flow, allowing for conditional execution of code blocks.

# Example 1: Simple if statement
age = 20
if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
    print("Please register to vote as soon as possible.")

# The `if-else` statement provides an alternative execution when the `if` condition is not met.
# Example 2: if-else statement
temperature = 30
if temperature > 25:
    print("It's a hot day.")
else:
    print("It's not a hot day.")

# The `if-elif-else` structure allows for multiple conditions to be checked sequentially.
# Example 3: if-elif-else statement
score = 75
if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: D or F")

# Assignment 1: Write a Python script that determines if a number is positive, negative, or zero using if-elif-else.
# Write your code below:


# Section 2: Logical and Boolean Operations
# -----------------------------------------
# Logical operators (and, or, not) are used to combine conditional statements.

# Example 4: Using logical operators
height = 175
weight = 70
if height > 170 and weight > 65:
    print("You are fit for the sports team.")
else:
    print("You do not meet the physical requirements for the sports team.")

# Example 5: Combining conditions with or
day = "Sunday"
if day == "Saturday" or day == "Sunday":
    print("It's the weekend!")
else:
    print("It's a weekday.")

# Assignment 2: Create a script that checks if a person is eligible for a senior citizen discount based on age and residency.
# Write your code below:


# Section 3: Real-World Applications
# -----------------------------------
# Applying conditional logic to solve real-world problems.

# Example 6: Nested if-elif-else in a real-world context
# Ticket pricing system with age and membership checks
age = 65
member = True

if age < 18:
    price = 10
elif age >= 18:
    if member:
        price = 15
    else:
        price = 20

    if age >= 65:
        price -= 5  # Discount for seniors

print(f"Ticket price: ${price}")

# Assignment 3: Write a script that simulates a basic login system. Check username and password correctness.
# Write your code below:



# Example 7: Loan Approval System
# This example uses multiple conditions to determine if an applicant qualifies for a personal loan.
income = 45000
credit_score = 700
employment_status = "employed"
existing_loans = False

if (income > 40000 and credit_score >= 650) and (employment_status == "employed" and not existing_loans):
    print("Loan approved.")
else:
    print("Loan denied.")

# Example 8: Environment Control System
# A system that adjusts temperature and humidity based on multiple sensor readings.
temperature = 22
humidity = 85
weather_outside = "rainy"

if temperature < 20 or (humidity > 80 and weather_outside == "rainy"):
    print("Turning on heating and dehumidifier.")
elif temperature > 30 or (humidity < 30 and weather_outside == "sunny"):
    print("Turning on air conditioning and humidifier.")
else:
    print("No change needed.")

# Example 9: Custom Shipping Logic
# Determine shipping costs based on weight, distance, and customer loyalty.
weight = 5  # in kilograms
distance = 300  # in kilometers
is_loyal_customer = True

if weight > 10:
    shipping_cost = 25
elif weight > 5:
    shipping_cost = 15
else:
    shipping_cost = 5

if distance > 200:
    shipping_cost += 10

if is_loyal_customer:
    shipping_cost *= 0.9  # 10% discount for loyal customers

print(f"Total shipping cost: ${shipping_cost:.2f}")

# Assignment 4: Implement a system that categorizes a day based on temperature and weather conditions.
# Use nested if-elif-else and logical operators to determine if it's a beach day, skiing day, or a stay-home day.
temperature = 30  # in Celsius
weather = "sunny"

if weather == "sunny":
    if temperature > 25:
        print("It's a perfect beach day.")
    elif temperature > 15:
        print("It's a nice day for a walk.")
    else:
        print("It's sunny but too cold, stay home.")
elif weather == "snowy":
    if temperature < 0:
        print("Great day for skiing.")
    else:
        print("Snowy but not ideal for skiing, stay home.")
else:
    print("Not a sunny or snowy day, best to stay indoors.")

### Comprehensive Database Design Documentation for a News Summarizer Application

This documentation is designed to guide industrial training participants through the process of designing and implementing a database for a news summarizer application. The design adheres to industry best practices, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and performance.

#### Database Design Considerations and Best Practices

1. **Normalization**: The schema is designed to be in Third Normal Form (3NF), which helps in minimizing redundancy and maximizing data integrity:
   - **Primary Key**: Each table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each record.
   - **No Transitive Dependency**: Non-key attributes depend only on the primary key.

2. **Foreign Keys**: Used to establish relationships between tables, maintaining referential integrity and ensuring data consistency.

3. **Data Types and Constraints**: Appropriate data types (e.g., `varchar`, `int`, `datetime`) optimize storage and improve query performance. Constraints ensure adherence to data rules, enhancing quality.

4. **Scalability and Performance**: The relational table structure supports easy indexing and partitioning, facilitating efficient data retrieval as the dataset grows.

5. **Security Considerations**: Sensitive information is separated into different tables and referenced by IDs, supporting better security practices.


> Below is a step-by-step guide to creating a database schema considering various entities involved and their relationships

#### Entities and Their Attributes

1. **News**: Represents individual news articles.
   - **Attributes**: id, category_id, reporter_id, publisher_id, datetime, title, body, link

2. **Category**: Represents the category of the news (e.g., Sports, Politics).
   - **Attributes**: id, name

3. **Reporter**: Represents the reporter of the news article.
   - **Attributes**: id, name, email

4. **Publisher**: Represents the publisher who publish the news article.
   - **Attributes**: id, name, email, head_office_address, phone_number, website, facebook, twitter, linkedin, instagram

5. **Image**: Represents images associated with the news article.
   - **Attributes**: id, news_id, image_url

6. **Summary**: Represents the summarized version of the news article, generated by a Language Learning Model (LLM).
   - **Attributes**: id, news_id, summary_text

#### Relationships

- A **News** article belongs to one **Category**, one **Reporter**, and one **Publisher**
- A **News** article can have multiple **Images**.
- Each **News** article has one **Summary**.

#### Explanation

- **Primary Keys (pk)**: Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
- **Foreign Keys (ref)**: Establishes a link between two tables.
- **Attributes Types**: `varchar` for strings, `int` for integers, `datetime` for date and time, `text` for longer text fields.
- **Increment**: Automatically increments the primary key value for new records.



#### Implementation Strategy

1. **Create the Tables**: Begin by creating the tables in your database management system (DBMS) according to the schema provided.

2. **Populate the Tables**: Insert initial data into `categories`, `authors`, and `editors` first, as these are referenced by the `news` table.

3. **Maintain Data Integrity**: Use transactions to maintain integrity, especially when inserting or updating data across multiple tables.

4. **Indexing**: Apply indexes on frequently queried columns (e.g., `category_id`, `author_id`, `editor_id` in the `news` table) to speed up search operations.

5. **Security Measures**: Implement role-based access controls in the DBMS to restrict who can view or modify certain data.

| 2  | 2           | 2           | 2            | 2023-01-02 15:00:00 | Soccer Match  | Soccer match...    | http://example.com/n2 |

images:
| id | news_id | image_url                      |
|----|---------|--------------------------------|
| 1  | 1       | http://example.com/img1.jpg    |
| 2  | 2       | http://example.com/img2.jpg    |

summaries:
| id | news_id | summary_text                   |
|----|---------|--------------------------------|
